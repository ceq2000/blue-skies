### Overview

This is a website with a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Moment.js is used to retrieve and manipulate the data. It provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. You can add new train to your scheduler with train number, line,	destination,	first departure	time, frequency, and	platform.
